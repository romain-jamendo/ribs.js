ribs.js 2.2.0
==============

This project is not ready for use in production. It's still under heavy development. I wrote this for another project I work on right now, but its still far from being stable. Testing are fixes and comments are welcome.

# typescript build command [needs typescript > 1.5.2]
	```
	cd /source
	tsc --target ES5 --module umd --outDir ../build --sourceMap ribs.ts collection.ts container.ts controller.ts eventsManager.ts model.ts router.ts view.ts viewHelper.ts
	```
	
## ribs project details
* extend backbone view to automate some tasks
* a must have is that views code should not contain any html markup, every bit of html should be in the template so that designers only have to touch that file
* new collection view to build lists and when destroyed auto close children
* new controller
* views loader based on requirejs
* collections batch save for all models at once

future:
* (?) use shadow dom for views (polymer shadow dom polyfill)

#ribs documentation

##ribs views

### onInitialize hook
* if you want to do stuff during initialization of the view
* don't try to append html to this.$el during onIntialize as it would get overwriten, instead use onRender

### onRender hook
* if you want to add programmatically stuff to the view during the rendering process use onRender
